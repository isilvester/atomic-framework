# Atomic Sass Framework

This is an outline of the framework that I discussed in [The Other Interface](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/02/other-interface-atomic-design-sass/). The aim of this system is to decrease the complexity of how front-end developers write Sass. By scoping similar styles together code should be faster to read and write as well as encouraging developers not to write bloated code.

This framework is inspired by [atomic design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and so it uses modules such as quarks, atoms and molecules as directories which separates the various partials and imports them into the control panel.

Please note that all of the code contained within this ‘framework’ is not production ready. This is simply an example and is not intended to be used on live projects, although you’re certainly free to extend the ideas contained here and make them more awesome.


## The system

### Control panel

### Utilities
*The basic plumbing of the website*. This directory of partials is important because we’ll need to define global classes, mixins and styles that can be used anywhere and at any time. For example if we need to use color variables throughout the site, then this is the directory that we would need access to.


### Quarks



### Atoms

### Molecules


## Requirements
- Sass
- Toolkit
